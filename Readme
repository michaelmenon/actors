An actor package in Go. Use it for scalable message passing in a process.
Actors are created with an ID and in return you will get a receive only channel to get messages.
Send a message to an actor by passing the ID.

usage go get github.com/michaelmenon/actors

actor, err := actors.AddActor("actorID")

//listen for messages 
for msg := <-actor{
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
//to remove an actor
actors.RemoveActor("actorID")

//in a seperate Goroutine send a message
actors.SendMessage("actorID", []byte("my message"))
